Rocket Replay Analysis is an analysis programs that combines the analysis of Ballchasing.com and Carball (from Calculated.gg) and highlights key stats for a player/ team/ game over a single match, series or length of time against a database.

Defunct now as carball is not being updated/ working for current replays.
